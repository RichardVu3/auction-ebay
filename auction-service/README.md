# Auction Service

## Quick Start

**Install packages**

```bash
cd /path/to/auction/service && pip install
```

**Setup Database**

The auction service uses MongoDB. You must have MongoDB running either locally or create a hosted remote database

The easiest way to get started with MongoDB is via the [official MongoDB Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo).

```bash
docker pull mongo
```

You can then run the `build.sh` script in the root directory.

```bash
chmod+x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This should start a new docker container using the MongoDB image. The image is
set to listen on the default port 27017. The port and container name can be set
manually via the docker `-p` flag and the `--name` flag. The
`MONGODB_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MONGOD_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` are set by
default to `mongoadmin` and `password` respectively.
See the [Docker Secrets section](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) on dockerhub for more information

**Start Dev Server**
In the root directory of the auction-service run:

```bash
fastapi dev
```

This will start the FastAPI web server on port `8000`. You can then start
sending http requests via an HTTP client. You can also use the autogenerated
docs at `localhost:8000/docs` to use the FastAPI Swagger interactive documentation.
